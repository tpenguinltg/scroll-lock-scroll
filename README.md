# Scroll Lock function restore

**This script is unmaintained as I no longer use Windows. Feel free to fork and adapt.**

An AutoHotkey script that restores the original function of scroll lock
in various applications.

When scroll lock is enabled, the arrow keys will scroll the viewport
instead of moving the text cursor in supported applications.

## Usage

Simply double-click the file to run the script. AutoHotkey is required.

To use the script without AuotHotkey, use the standalone exe instead.

Both files can be found on the [releases page][].
